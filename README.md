# fuck-u3DS
A 3ds homebrew app that displays "fuck you" on your screen, inspired by the Switch Homebrew app fuck-u <br />
The original fuck-u (not by me) https://github.com/lolicop123/fuck-u <br />
Thank you https://github.com/GlaZedBelmont for helping me inprove my code, the dev chat on NH for helping make all of this, the creators of the 3ds Examples for providing test examples. <br />
